# Intro <a name = "Intro"></a>

This project was developed previously for 'LarissaKich', found on youtube with the title 
""" FormulÃ¡rio de Cadastro RESPONSIVO (Responsive Registration Form) | HTML e CSS """
However, during my development I changed the background color of the hover button to make the change more visible. The main change is that I created the project in VITE, creating the form, general form, image components; where the form and image components were called in the general form; and the general form was called in app.jsx.

<!--
