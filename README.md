# Intro <a name = "Intro"></a>

This project was previously developed for 'LarissaKich', found on YouTube with the title """ RESPONSIVE Registration Form | HTML and CSS """; and by Matheus Manuel, with the title """RESPONSIVE REGISTRATION FORM | Registration page | HTML AND CSS""".

 However, during my development the main change is that I created the project in react-vite, and instead of the index.html file I used the app.js file; and instead of the index.html file I used the app.js file; and I made a small change to the background color of the buttons to make the change more visible..

In youtube's video this project was developed with Html, CSS.

However, during my development the main change is that I created the project in VITE, creating the form, general form, image components; where the form and image components were called in the general form; and the general form was called in app.jsx; and beyond that, I also changed the background color of the button on hover to make the change more visible.
